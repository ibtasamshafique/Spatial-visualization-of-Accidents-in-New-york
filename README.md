I have created this streamlit app for spatial visualization of Accidents in New york Data Set. It is an interactive app and uses streamlit library. You can adjust timings of the day and number of people injured in accidents to dynamically observe how their different combinations are correlated. You just need to install streamlit and run app.py and it will automatically do the rest. Happy interacting with this app
